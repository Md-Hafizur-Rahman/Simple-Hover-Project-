            <h2>DHAKA CITY</h2>
            <p>Dhaka (/ˈdɑːkə/ DAH-kə or /ˈdækə/ DAK-ə; Bengali: ঢাকা, pronounced [ɖʱaka]); formerly known as Dacca[11] is the capital and largest city of Bangladesh. It is one of the world's largest cities, with a population of 18.89 million people in the Greater Dhaka Area.[12][6][13] It is also the 4th most densely populated city in the world. Dhaka is the chief economic, political and cultural center of Bangladesh. It is one of the major cities of South Asia, the largest city in Eastern South Asia and among the Bay of Bengal countries; and one of the largest cities among OIC countries. As part of the Bengal plain, the city is bounded by the Buriganga River, Turag River, Dhaleshwari River and Shitalakshya River. The city is located in an eponymous district and division.</p>

                <h2>FLYOVER IN DHAKA</h2>
                <p>To the chagrin of urban and regional planning experts, Bangladesh continues to construct gargantuan flyovers in what can be described as ‘putting a plaster on’ approach to dealing with the nightmarish traffic situation the country now experiences. Professors of city planning are disappointed at this myopic approach and argue for a drastic change in traffic demand management policies.</p>
